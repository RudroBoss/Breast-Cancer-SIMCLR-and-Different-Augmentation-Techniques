# Breast-Cancer-SIMCLR-and-Different-Augmentation-Techniques
SimCLR-based breast cancer classification using multiple augmentation techniques (CoarseDropout, Gamma, Cropped Regions, Random Swapping, DCL &amp; Random Jigsaw). Achieved up to 98.99% val &amp; 98.31% test accuracy. Each model analyzed with saliency maps, LIME explanations, and feature map visualizations for interpretability.
Some parts of this code can be found in the paper, "Towards Explainable Breast Cancer Classification Using SimCLR-Based Self-Supervised Representation Learning", which can be accessed via DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-7812447/v1
